# Write a small program that assigns the value 5 to one variable, called x, and the value 7 to another, called y.
# Your program should then use an if statement to compare the values, and print out x is greater than y if x is greater,
# or x is smaller than y if y is greater. If x equals y, print out x equals y
# I know you don't really need a computer to tell you the result,
# but we're getting practice at writing if/elif/else statements.
# Once your program is working, copy and paste it into a new file in your IDE, and test it with different values for x and y.
# This coding system is looking for the output when x is 5 and y is 7, so you can't use this to test other values.
# Pasting the code into your usual IDE will let you do that.

x  = 5
y = 7

if x > y :
    print("x is greater than y")
elif x < y :
    print("x is smaller than y")
else:
    print("x equals y")

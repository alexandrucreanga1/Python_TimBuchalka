# Write a small program that assigns the name of 2 trees to 2 variables, called tree1 and tree2.
#If the values of the 2 variables are equal, print the message The trees are the same,
# otherwise print The trees are different.
# This exercise system doesn't allow input to be used, so don't use input on lines 1 and 2 - just
# enter your text inside the quotes for the 2 trees.

tree1 = 'maria'
tree2 = 'maria'

if tree1 == tree2 :
    print("The trees are the same.")

    print("The trees are different.")

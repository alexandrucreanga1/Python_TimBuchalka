# You have a shop selling buns for $2.40 each.
# A customer comes in with $15, and would like to buy as many buns as possible.
# Complete the code to calculate how many buns the customer can afford.

bun_price = 2.40
money = 15
no_buns = 15 % 2.40
no_buns2 = 15/2.4
no_buns3 = 15//2.4

print(no_buns)
print(no_buns2)
print(no_buns3) #corect answer!
